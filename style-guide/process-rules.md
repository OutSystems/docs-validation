# Writing processes

## Title

* Start with a verb in the gerund form (For example, "Streaming log data" or "Authenticating REST API").

## Purpose

* Describe the high-level end-to-end tasks needed to implement, set up, or configure a capability.

## Prerequisites

* Clearly list the requirements (For example, tools, permissions, or prior steps) before starting the process.

## High-level process

* Add a high-level diagram (For example, sequence diagram, flow chart) to describe the tasks involved.
* Use a lead-in sentence followed by a bulleted or numbered list of high-level tasks.
* Focus on describing tasks, not detailed step-by-step instructions.
* Answer key questions:
  * What are the tasks needed to implement the capability?
  * Why are these tasks necessary?

## Examples

* Provide examples to clarify the process (For example, setting up log streaming).

## Next steps

* Include references and links to related documentation or procedures.
* Ensure logical connections to guide users to additional information.

## Related resources (optional)

* Provide links to relevant OutSystems or external resources for further guidance.
* Group resources by content type and include a short introductory sentence.
