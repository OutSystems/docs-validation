== Working with files

Read this section to learn more about the Markdown file structure, naming conventions, and how to add files to the table of content.

=== Naming conventions

Recommendations to follow when naming.

===== Document titles

Use only letters, numbers, and hyphens. Never use other special chars, even `(`, `)`, or `_`.

===== Files and folders

Here are some conventions you should follow for file and folder names:

* Use only letters, numbers, and hyphens. Never use other special chars.
* Write file and folder names in lowercase with word-separating hyphens. Do not use underscores or spaces for this purpose.
* Folder names should be short and descriptive. They don't have to match the topic name, and may abbreviate some words (for example, "application" to "app").
* Topics on similar subjects, when placed in the same folder, may share the same short prefix. This makes them easier to find.
* Limit the number of files at the folder level. Review the list of files and organize them into subfolders, if needed.

===== Image file names

Also, the image file names should include the following:

* One keyword from the topic filename at the beginning, especially if there are a few topics in the same folder. 
* A few words describing the image (not too many)
* Suffix to identify the source of the image:
** `ss` — includes user interface elements from Service Studio, even if it's not a simple screenshot
** `odcs` — includes user interface elements from OutSystems Developer Cloud Studio
** `is` — includes user interface elements from Integration Studio
** `lt` — includes user interface elements from LifeTime
** `sc` — includes user interface elements from Service Center
** `pl` — includes user interface elements from the ODC Portal
** `usr` — includes user interface elements from Users
** `ct` — includes user interface elements from Configuration Tool
** `af` — includes user interface elements from App Feedback Tool
** `gc` — includes user interface elements from Google Console
** `fg` — includes user interface elements from Forge
** `ams` — includes user interface elements from AI Mentor Studio
** `ib` — includes user interface elements from Integration Builder
** `eb` — includes user interface elements from Experience Builder
** `az` — includes user interface elements from Microsoft Azure
** `vs` — includes user interface elements from Visual Studio
** `ok` — includes user interface elements from Okta
** `fc` — includes user interface elements from Factory Configuration
** `diag` — the image contains a diagram, a workflow, or similar, with no elements from the product tools user interface
** (none) — screenshots from sample apps, or other unspecified cases

If necessary, image filenames may include a number before the suffix, but adding another word is preferable.

*Examples*

Here are some sample image file names:

* roles-create-lt.png
* roles-edit-lt.png
* application-architecture-diag.png
* flow-editor-1-ss.png
* flow-editor-2-ss.png
* flow-editor-properties-ss.png

===== Branches

Suggested names:

* Prefix with **update-** to update existing content
* Prefix with **feature-** to add new content


=== Structure of a Markdown file 

Markdown files have the following sections:

* *Header* or *front-matter*. Contains topic metadata.
* *Title*. The topic title that by default also defines the page URL when published. Always use a Heading 1 to define the title (check "Headings"). After the header, insert two line breaks and then write the title of the topic as Heading 1. Leave an empty line after this heading and then write the body of the topic.
* *Body*. The content of the topic. Can contain text, tables, images, videos, and similar.

=== File header of a Markdown file 

The file header or front-matter of a Markdown file contains metadata that's not rendered as body text. The header starts in the first line with `---` (three hyphen characters), has one entry per line, and ends with `---` (three hyphen characters), followed by two line breaks and one empty line. Insert two line breaks after the header.
For more information about the front-matter, see [Validate markdown frontmatter](https://outsystemsrd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TK/pages/3602121571/Validate+markdown+frontmatter).


=== File organization

Each documentation area or a section in a repository should have a specific folder. Check below for the folder naming conventions and recommendations.

Each section should have an overview topic, placed inside the section folder. The topic name should be `intro-<some-keywords>.md`.

Put:

* All images of a single topic in an `images/subfolder`.
* Resources related to a topic, for example, downloadable files, samples, demos, in a `resources/` folder.
* Any images or icons reused throughout the documentation in a common `/shared/` folder at the root of the repository.

*Examples*

A sample folder structure:

----
src/
    intro-doc-10.md
    getting-started.md
    images/
        getting-started-overview-ss.png
    apps-lifecycle/
        intro.md
        role-create.md
        role-permissions.md
        team-create.md
        team-app-permissions.md
        images/
            overview-diag.png
            roles-lt.png
        resources/
            cheatsheet.pdf
----

Here is a possible folder organization with a folder for shared images:

----
src/
    shared/
        icons-tools/
            <...>.png
        icons-elements/
            <...>.png
----

=== Table of contents

After creating a new topic you must add it to the table of contents (TOC) so that it can be published. The table of contents is defined per repository in the *toc.yml* file, available in the root folder.

Each entry is defined by a hyphen, a space, the `href: ` text and the UNIX-style path (using `/` forward slashes to separate parts) from the `src/` folder up to the Markdown filename.

Child topics are defined after a `- topics` entry, using an extra level of indentation (four spaces).

[source, yaml]
----
- href: app-lifecycle/intro.md
- topics:
    - href: app-lifecycle/app-deploy.md
    - href: app-lifecycle/troubleshooting.md
