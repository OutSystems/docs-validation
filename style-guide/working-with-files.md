# Working with files

## Working with files

Read this section to learn more about the Markdown file structure, naming conventions, and how to add files to the table of contents.

### Naming conventions

Recommendations to follow when naming.

#### Document titles

- Use only letters, numbers, and hyphens. Never use other special chars, even `(`, `)`, or `_`.

#### Files and folders

Here are some conventions you should follow for file and folder names:

- Use only letters, numbers, and hyphens. Never use other special chars.
- Write file and folder names in lowercase with word-separating hyphens. Do not use underscores or spaces for this purpose.
- Folder names should be short and descriptive. They don't have to match the topic name, and may abbreviate some words (for example, "application" to "app").
- Topics on similar subjects, when placed in the same folder, may share the same short prefix. This makes them easier to find.
- Limit the number of files at the folder level. Review the list of files and organize them into subfolders, if needed.

#### Image file names

Also, the image file names should include the following:

- One keyword from the topic filename at the beginning, especially if there are a few topics in the same folder.
- A few words describing the image (not too many)
- Suffix to identify the source of the image:
  - `ss` — includes user interface elements from Service Studio, even if it's not a simple screenshot
  - `odcs` — includes user interface elements from OutSystems Developer Cloud Studio
  - `is` — includes user interface elements from Integration Studio
  - `lt` — includes user interface elements from LifeTime
  - `sc` — includes user interface elements from Service Center
  - `pl` — includes user interface elements from the ODC Portal
  - `usr` — includes user interface elements from Users
  - `at` — includes user interface elements from Assessment Tool
  - `ct` — includes user interface elements from Configuration Tool
  - `af` — includes user interface elements from App Feedback Tool
  - `gc` — includes user interface elements from Google Console
  - `fg` — includes user interface elements from Forge
  - `ams` — includes user interface elements from AI Mentor Studio
  - `ib` — includes user interface elements from Integration Builder
  - `eb` — includes user interface elements from Experience Builder
  - `we` — includes user interface elements from Workflow Editor
  - `az` — includes user interface elements from Microsoft Azure
  - `vs` — includes user interface elements from Visual Studio
  - `ok` — includes user interface elements from Okta
  - `fc` — includes user interface elements from Factory Configuration
  - `diag` — the image contains a diagram, a workflow, or similar, with no elements from the product tools user interface
