# General guidelines for procedures

## Use task-based headings

* Start with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., "Create a screen" or "Install a Forge app").
* Avoid gerunds (e.g., "Creating a screen").

## Include an introduction

* Provide a brief overview of the procedure, explaining what the user will achieve and why it is important.
* Identify the audience or skill level (e.g., beginner or experienced developer).

## Place prerequisites at the top

* List any requirements (e.g., tools, permissions, or prior steps) before the procedure begins.
* Ensure prerequisites are clear and concise.

## Use numbered steps

* Write steps in a logical order, using numbers to indicate sequence.
* Each step should describe a single action.

## Follow the 3w rule

* **Why**: Explain the purpose of the step (optional).
* **Where**: Indicate the location or context for the action.
* **What**: Specify the action to be performed.

## Limit the number of steps

* Aim for 7â€“9 steps per procedure. If more steps are needed, break the procedure into smaller sections or sub-procedures.

## Add content after headings

* Include at least one sentence after a heading to introduce the content that follows (e.g., images, tables, or steps).

## Use infoboxes sparingly

* Highlight critical information (e.g., warnings or tips) only when necessary to avoid overuse.

## Use links judiciously

* Limit the number of links in the procedure to avoid distractions.
* Place additional resources in a "Related Resources" section at the end.

## Add a summary

* Provide a brief summary at the end of the procedure, recapping the key points or outcomes.

## Add rationales for steps

* When necessary, explain why a step is important to help users understand its purpose.

These rules ensure that procedures are user-friendly, consistent, and easy to follow. Let me know if you need further assistance!
