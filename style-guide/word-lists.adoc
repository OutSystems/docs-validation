=== Word list resources

Here are the resources we recommend you consult.

* "A—Z word list and term collections" from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide[Microsoft Style Guide]. We recommend using the suggestion from Microsoft Style Guide, unless they are different from suggestions by OutSystems.
* "Style and Usage" from https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/[Apple Style Guide] is another great resource. Give precedence to OutSystems and Microsoft recommendations.
