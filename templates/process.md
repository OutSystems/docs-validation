# [Process title - starts with verb+ing]
**Example:** "Creating a screen template"

{A process document describes in high-level the steps needed to complete a task end-to-end. For example, the process to set up log streaming involves the following steps:
1. Retrieve the APM server tool authentication credentials.
2. (Optional) Set up OpenTelemetry collector.
3. Configure LifeTime.

Some of these steps can be separate procedures.

The process document helps developers to quickly understand the overall workflow, the sequence of major tasks, and the end result. It also serve as a bridge between conceptual information and detailed procedures, offering essential context and guidance for successfully implementing a capability.}

## [Paragraph] *(No heading)*
<<<<<<< HEAD
{ An intro sentence or paragraph that provides a summary of steps needed to complete the task. For example, To set up the log streaming, you must retrieve the APM server authentication details then if needed set up the OpenTelemetry collector and configure log streaming in LifeTime with these details.  } 
=======
{An **intro sentence or paragraph** that describes at a high level how a particular use case is completed and the end result of that use case. A use case can comprise multiple tasks.} 



**Example**  
{Use OutSystems Screen Templates to create your own web and mobile screen templates with predefined layouts, widgets, styles, and logic. After cloning and publishing the template, customize it to your needs. Then, the template is available to reuse across any of your other apps and by other developers."}

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
List the **high-level tasks** you have to complete to accomplish a particular use case.
>>>>>>> 5ba2c91324481160b3329c9f7c026cccb69bdb48

* Add a high-level diagram such as sequence diagram, flow charts, process flow that describes the steps to complete the task end-to-end.
  
* List the high-level steps to complete the task.

Start with a lead-in sentence, followed by a bulleted or numbered list of the high-level steps or procedures.

* Describe the high-level steps, not detailed step-by-step instructions.  
  Answer questions like:  
    * What are the steps needed to complete the task?
