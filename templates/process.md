# TK Template for a Process

Use this template to document a process.

A process helps users understand the what and why of performing a task. A process provides the reader with generic information on how a task is accomplished. The reader is not expected to complete the task based on the process, but does need details to help understand the complexities of the process.

A process does not include step-by-step instructions. Rather a process explains the sequence of events that lead up to the completion of the process. It is a set of related tasks that describe the best practices.

The title of the process should always start  with a gerund (ing form of a verb), such as Creating an email instead of Create an email.

When writing a process,  include the following sections and follow the guidelines provided.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Section</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Guidelines</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Introduction
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>A sentence that introduces the process and provides a definition of what a user creates (the final output)
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>The body
   </td>
   <td>Answer these questions:
<ul>

<li>What are the inputs - what is needed to perform the process?

<li>What are the outputs - what is the end result ?

<li>What tasks must the user complete during this process (high-level)?
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Imagery - flow diagrams, images, and screenshots
   </td>
   <td>Flow diagrams show users how all the pieces of the process work together. Images and screenshots that support the flow can also be used.
<ul>

<li>Use flow diagrams to show the process.

<li>Use images to support the flow diagram.

<li>Use screenshots when needed to provide context.

<li>When taking a screenshot set display resolution to 1920 x 1080 and the scale and the layout to 100%.

<li>Place imagery directly beneath the paragraph in which it  is mentioned.

<li>Do not rely only on the imagery to provide information. Be sure to write the information in the paragraph.
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The following is an example of a process.  

# Creating a screen template

Screen Templates are Screens with predefined layouts, widgets, styles, and logic. You can create Screens from a Screen Template. When you create a Screen from a Screen Template you start with sample data that you can then replace.

OutSystems provides Screen Templates which you can use as a starting point but you can also create your own templates. To start with an OutSystems Screen Template, you can clone one of the forge components:

* [Custom Screen Templates Reactive](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/7127/custom-screen-templates-reactive) for Reactive Web Apps
* [Custom Screen Templates Mobile](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/5060/custom-screen-templates-mobile) for Mobile Apps
* [Custom Screen Templates Traditional Web](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/5089/custom-screen-templates-web) for Traditional Web Apps

To use the Screen Template; download, clone, rename, and publish it. The module is now available locally from the **Development** tab in the **Independent Modules** section.

You can make any changes you want to the template.  When done, you can move the template module to the application in which you want to use it.

**REMEMBER TO DELETE THIS LINE AND EVERYTHING ABOVE**

# Replace with Process name

[Include an introduction that describes the final output.]

[One or more paragraphs that explains how (not the steps) to complete the task. Answer the questions listed above.]
