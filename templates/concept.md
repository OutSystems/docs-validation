## UI Screens

An OutSystems Screen is a user interface (UI) element that contains other elements in which users interact. When working in a Reactive Web App, the Screen you create can render as a web page, or mobile Screens in a reactive web app. You can access UI screens in Service Studio on the **Interface** tab in the **UI Flows** folder.

You can create a Screen either by starting with an empty Screen by using a Screen template. An empty Screen contains the basic layout for you to add widgets. A Screen template has predefined layouts, widgets, components, styles, and logic.

Screens enable you to create a standard look and feel for your applications making it easier for users to navigate your application. The benefit of an empty Screen is that you can design the layout any way you want. The benefit of a screen template is that you can quickly create a demo that shows a working UI.
