# [Concept title - use a noun] 

{A concept document serves as a comprehensive guide, offering clear, concise, and consistent information on a specific concept. By providing essential background information, it enables readers to align their existing knowledge with the tasks they need to perform and gain valuable insights into the new OutSystems capability. For example, a conceptual document on business process provides the context and rationale for workflows in ODC. It helps users and developers grasp the bigger picture before diving into specifics.}

## *[Optional Paragraph]*   
{Define the concept so that you and your reader will have a shared understanding of the language used throughout the document. Think of it as a glossary definition. Also, define the scope of the concept - define its boundaries, what you'll cover in a document and how deep into details you will dive and the extent of the details you will provide.}

{Sometimes, concepts are explained by using analogies that the user should be familiar with.
For example, while explaining the complex topic of how electricity goes through wires, you could relate it to a more familiar topic, such as how water goes through pipes.
It helps to bridge knowledge gaps.}

{Stick to problem-solution or benefit-focused language.}

{Address the key questions of what, when, who, why, where, and how (5W and 1H), placing these explanations near the beginning of your document.}

## [Paragraph] *(Heading is optional)*  
[**A high-level statement** about **how people can use the feature** to accomplish common tasks, instead of what a feature does.]

**Example**  
Use the cards widget to create the tiles on an employee directory portal. To express your brand personality, customize the text color inside the card widgets and match it to you brand color theme. For example, use color text on headlines to draw attention to an employee's name on a tile. 

## [Paragraph] *(Heading is optional)*  
[**The benefits** of using the feature.]

**Example**  
A benefit of OutSystems UI Screens is that you can focus on design rather than development. Focusing on accessibility and usefulness makes it easier to use your app.

## [Paragraph] *(Heading is optional)* 
[A **use case** that draws a picture in the mind of the reader and demonstrates any benefits.]

**Example**  
Design an employee directory portal by dragging and dropping different widgets from the Service Studio Toolbox into an empty screen in your app. For a simple layout, use cards and images to display tiles on screen that contain the employee's picture, name, role, and location. This enables you to create and preview a quick demo of a functioning UI screen, which you can further customize to include things like a Search bar, filters, pagination, and much more.

**DELETE THIS SECTION:**  
Remember, if you start to describe another concept, stop yourself. Each concept should talk about one concept only.
Start a new concept with its own title (and link to it, as needed).
