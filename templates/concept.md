# [Concept title - use a noun] 
**Example:** "UI screen design". Don’t use generic titles like “Introduction”, “Overview”, “Use cases” or “How it works”. Instead, use a more specific noun or phrase that someone would search for.

## *[Optional Paragraph]*   
*[Background information or recommended knowledge. Something people must know or do prior to working with this feature.]*  

## [Paragraph] *(Heading is optional)*  
[**A high-level statement** about **how people can use the feature** to accomplish common tasks, instead of what a feature does.]

**Example**  
Use the cards widget to create the tiles on an employee directory portal. To express your brand personality, customize the text color inside the card widgets and match it to you brand color theme. For example, use color text on headlines to draw attention to an employee's name on a tile. 

## [Paragraph] *(Heading is optional)*  
[**The benefits** of using the feature.]

**Example**  
A benefit of OutSystems UI Screens is that you can focus on design rather than development. Focusing on accessibility and usefulness makes it easier to use your app.

## [Paragraph] *(Heading is optional)* 
[A **use case** that draws a picture in the mind of the reader and demonstrates any benefits.]

**Example**  
Design an employee directory portal by dragging and dropping different widgets from the Service Studio Toolbox into an empty screen in your app. For a simple layout, use cards and images to display tiles on screen that contain the employee's picture, name, role, and location. This enables you to create and preview a quick demo of a functioning UI screen, which you can further customize to include things like a Search bar, filters, pagination, and much more.

Remember, if you start to describe another concept, stop yourself. Each concept should talk about one concept only.
Start a new concept with its own title (and link to it, as needed).
