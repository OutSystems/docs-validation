# TK Procedure Template

Use this template to create a procedure. A procedure provides instructions to
complete a task that solves a specific use case.  The title of the procedure
should always start with How to.

When writing a procedure include the following sections and follow the
guidelines provided.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Section</strong>

  <tr>
   <td>Opening Paragraph(s)
   </td>
   <td>Answer these questions:
<ul>
<li>Are there any prerequisites that users must complete prior to starting this
procedure? If yes, provide a link to the topics.
<li>What will the reader accomplish?
<li>Why is the procedure important?
<li>How does this procedure relate to a larger process?
<li>Is there a concept or a process that is related?  (Depending upon the
content you might want to link to that topic).

   <td>Lead-in sentence to procedure
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>
<li>If explained in the introductory paragraph to the procedure, and the
procedure follows the paragraph, then no lead-in sentence is necessary.
<li>If a lead-in sentence is necessary use â€œTo  ________________, follow these
steps:

  <tr>
   <td>Steps or bullets
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>
<li>If the steps must follow in sequence, use numbered steps.
<li>If the steps do not follow a sequence, use bullets.
<li>If this is a single step procedure, use a sentence.
<li>It is recommended that you limit the number steps (seven to nine) in
accordance with the <a
href="https://github.com/OutSystems/docs-validation/blob/master/style-guide/structure.adoc#limit-the-number-of-steps-in-procedures">TK
Style Guide</a>.
<li>If more than ten steps are required, try to break the steps into two
procedures.
<li>If you break the procedure into two procedures, and you want to keep both of
them in one topic then use a heading to separate the two procedures.
<li>When writing each step follow this rule:
<ul>
<li>Position the user in the location.
<li>Tell the user what to do.
<li>Tell the user the result of their action.
<li>For example: In the Edit menu, click Paste to insert the copied content.
</li>
</ul>

   <td>Screenshots or graphics within steps or paragraphs

   <td>Screenshots are pictures of the UI and may or more may not have a callout
or box around an area. A graphic is a representation that helps to create a
mental image.
<ul>
<li>Use screenshots when needed to provide context.
<li>Set the display resolution to 1920 x 1080 and the scale and layout to 100%.
<li>It is recommended that you limit the  area of the screenshot to the part of
the UI where you want the reader to focus.
<li>Make sure to include enough surrounding detail to help the user locate the
item.
<li>Place the screenshot directly beneath the step or paragraph in which it  is
mentioned.
<li>Do not rely only on the screen shot to provide information. Be sure to write
the information in the step.
